Hi, I'm **Eddy Luten** and I'm a **software engineer** with two decades of professional experience. Over the course of my career, I've discovered a passion for building systems that solve problems efficiently.

I currently work at [Murj](https://www.murj.com/) as Application Development Manager where I get to work on interesting projects every day.

You may also know me as the guy who wrote [openglbook.com](http://openglbook.com) or from various other Open-Source things.

Feel free to [get in touch](mailto:eluten@pm.me) if you need help solving a problem and think I could help.

## What I Do

I've been lucky enough to be exposed to a large number of programming languages, frameworks, and technologies over the years, including:

* React
* AngularJS
* Ruby on Rails
* PHP
* MVC.NET
* Rust
* C and C++
* OpenGL
* Much more, detailed on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eddyluten)
