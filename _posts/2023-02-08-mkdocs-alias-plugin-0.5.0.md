The latest version, v0.5.0, of my mkdocs-alias-plugin is now available [here](https://github.com/EddyLuten/mkdocs-alias-plugin). This new version adds the ability to use the use_relative_link config flag, which causes the plugin to generate relative links to the aliased document rather than absolute ones. This flag is useful for those who host their wikis in subdirectories.

mkdocs-alias-plugin is an MkDocs plugin allowing links to your pages using a custom alias such as `[[my-alias]]` or `[[my-alias|My Title]]`.
