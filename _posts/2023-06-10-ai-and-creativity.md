After using ChatGPT for a few months, I'm developing a sour taste for the whole generative AI thing. It's not because it's not good at what it does. Most of the time, it's _incredibly_ proficient. I've mainly used ChatGPT to bounce ideas off and to give me suggestions -- riffing on concepts. It's an excellent tool for those tasks, usually generating a decent output. It's not because of that. I'm beginning to dislike generative AI because it makes you feel like you've had anything to do with the creative process.

I get this uneasy feeling when I ask ChatGPT to "create" something more substantial than a list of ideas based on a prompt. There's a voice that lingers in the basement of my mind while ChatGPT spits out another paragraph:

> This prompt expresses my creativity, therefore the output is a product of my imagination; I made this.

I can fine-tune a prompt for hours to generate an output that resembles what I expect to see. I put in the effort, and the result improves over time. It is almost like I imagined it myself. And when I click the "Regenerate Answer" button, I receive something else entirely, but equally good.

It's satisfying, but I still feel uneasy. Sure, though I've shaped the content through my prompts, I didn't imagine it. It's not even in my style. If anything, I'm simply passively consuming the output. Then, when I think it's good enough, I can choose to distribute it, iterate on it, or use it in my own work. Creativity is not part of this process.

The basement voice objects:

> Yeah, but given enough time and effort, I would have come up with something similar eventually.

No matter how much I want the idea to be my own, it's simply not true. When I sit down and plot a story, it inherits my experiences, interests, and environment. ChatGPT is entirely separate from these things and will pull from the same sources every time, no matter how much you tweak the prompt.

> But so do you!

Yes, but they're _my_ sources, not someone else's.

I like ChatGPT because it makes it easy to _feel_ creative. I like it because it's this near-magical thing that entertains me. I like it because I don't have to suffer as much through the blank-page period.

None of these things benefit me.

If creativity comes without effort, I'm not being creative. I'm not improving my creative skills if I ask someone or something else to do the work for me. At most, I'm commissioning a piece. At worst, I'm consuming someone else's work and calling it my own. By definition of being _externally generated_, it cannot be a reflection of my personality.

> So, am I rejecting ChatGPT and generative AI entirely?

No, I still think it's a useful tool for validating ideas, especially non-creative ones. For example, it's great for generating boilerplate code. But I will no longer use AI tools when what I'm creating is supposed to mean something to me.
