This is probably one of the coolest ideas that I've seen on the Internet in a loooong long time. Google Music Trends is a small program that you download that interacts with your music player and uploads statistics to Google. At the moment the most listened to song is "In the end" by Linkin Park. Of course this has to change ;)
