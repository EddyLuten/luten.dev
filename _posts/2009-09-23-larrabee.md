Intel demoed Larrabee for the first time to the public at the IDF (Intel Developer Forum), according to PC Pro.

The attached screenshot is a bit underwhelming but maybe we'll see some impressive examples soon. In any case, if the demo is at the IDF now, the public release couldn't be far off.

## Edit (2010)

In case you haven't heard â€” it seems like Larrabee was cancelled for good.
