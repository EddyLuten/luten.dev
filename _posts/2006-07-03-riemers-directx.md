I've always had a thing for 3D and CG. So when I started programming most of my findings were either graphics or web related. More recently I've been delving into C# making tiny applications to connect to MySQL, rename files and an entire CMS from the desktop. But the CG world keeps having a magnetic pull on me so the last couple of months I've been trying out Managed DirectX in the C# programming language. Anyway, what this post is about is that there's a great place for tutorials on this matter (C# and C++) written by Riemer Grootjans of riemers.net. This website is a very complete collection of DirectX and D3D tutorials, so go check them out here:
