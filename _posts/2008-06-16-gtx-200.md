NVIDIA [officially announced](https://web.archive.org/web/20090207202531/http://www.nvidia.com/object/io_1213610051114.html) its new line of GPUs today on their website. Two models from the line have been announced, namely the GTX 260 and the GTX 280.

NVIDIA claims that the cards have a 50% performance increase over the Geforce 8800 Ultra (figures anyone?). Below are some highlighted specs for the high-end GTX 280:

## NVIDIA Geforce GTX 280 Specs

Processor Cores | 240
Graphics Clock | 602 MHz
Processor Clock | 1,296 MHz
Texture fill rate | 48.2 billion/second

Memory Clock | 1,107 MHz

I’d love to see a benchmark done on this puppy.
