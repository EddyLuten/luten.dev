This weekend I took the time to find all of my ancient blog posts from various now-defunct blogs and stick them here. Finally, all of my failed projects are collected in one place!

All self-deprecation aside, though, it was a fun romp down memory lane and a humbling one. I remember writing some of the older posts and thinking they were just the best. Rereading them with 38-year-old eyes made it apparent that I was another young fool with a keyboard.

I'm sure I'll feel the same about my current output in another decade or two.

There is some good stuff there, though. Some more article-like posts about graphics and C++ are still readable but outdated.

Notably, there are entire years of posts missing, and not the old ones like you'd expect. For some reason, in 2013, I asked the Internet Archive to un-archive my main blog. Why? I don't know, but I also can't find my git repos for those old posts. They are now gone, and that stings a bit.

Hopefully, I'll be able to recover that one day. There's a specific post about linear allocators that I'd like to read again.
