## First Alpha release of Firefox 3

And you can get it: [Here from Mozilla.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20070314110627/http://www.mozilla.org/developer/#builds) if you’re interested in trying it out. I am, I’ll report on it later.

## Zune Again

I was actually wondering if anybody has actually seen a “Zune” since the introduction on November 14th this year. I haven’t, and I’ve seen one commercial so far on the TV. Even on the internet, I haven’t seen many things yet (or maybe I’m just on the wrong sites). I have some colleagues that didn’t even know what “a Zune” is and didn’t bother to find out.

## Nintendo Sued

A company named Interlink has sued Nintendo over the type of remote the Wii is using. interlink claims to have a patent on the motion technology, yet [ArsTechnica claims](https://web.archive.org/web/20070314110627/http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20061208-8385.html) this is not entirely true. I think that Interlink knew that Nintendo was going to use this technology long ago but just waited for the actual release so they could get lots of money out of law suits. Dontcha love how money works? ;) [src](https://web.archive.org/web/20070314110627/http://tweakers.net/nieuws/45512/Nintendo-aangeklaagd-wegens-patentschending-Wii-mote.html)
