I just can't seem to stop myself from making more MkDocs plugins. This time, it's a plugin that can help with editing by allowing you to edit your Markdown files straight from the browser:

Install [the package](https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs-live-edit-plugin/) by using pip:

```sh
pip install mkdocs-live-edit-plugin
```

This makes it easier to make small changes to wiki pages without constantly having to Alt+Tab back and forth. I have some more ideas to extend this plugin's capabilities such as creating new pages and moving pages, but that'll have to wait for a future version. For now, if you end up using it, I'm interested to know what you think about it.

You can get your own copy of the plugin [right here](https://github.com/EddyLuten/mkdocs-live-edit-plugin).
