A few updates for those folks who use any of my MkDocs plugins follow below.

## Live Edit Plugin

Version 0.1.4 of the [mkdocs-live-edit-plugin](https://github.com/EddyLuten/mkdocs-live-edit-plugin) was released containing changes to how the WebSocket connection to the MkDocs server is made. Also included are some error-handling improvements and visual feedback in the browser for when the WebSocket connection fails.

## Alias Plugin

Version 0.7.0 of the [mkdocs-alias-plugin](https://github.com/EddyLuten/mkdocs-alias-plugin) was released, removing the `use_relative_link` option introduced in version 0.5.0 of the plugin. Newer versions of MkDocs prefer relative links over absolute links, so all links created by the plugin are now relative by default, cutting down on a potential deluge of build warnings for large wikis (ask me how I know).

## Categories Plugin

Much like the alias plugin, the categories plugin now also generates relative links to eliminate build errors generated by absolute links. Version 0.5.0 of the [mkdocs-categories-plugin](https://github.com/EddyLuten/mkdocs-categories-plugin) includes these changes.
