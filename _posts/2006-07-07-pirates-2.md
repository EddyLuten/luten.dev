Last night at 12:01 AM Pirates of the Carribean: Dead Man's Chest premiered to the public throughout the country. So my wife and I went to see it since we were big fans of the original movie. I have to say that this movie is BIG, I mean huge in production. The special effects, the acting and the scenery are all incredible. Johnny Depp's performance was incredible and Orlando Bloom topped himself on this one. I can't go in to details about the movie here since I'd spoil it for everyone, but the end of the movie was strange. Not at all what you'd expect from a movie like this. Anyway, go see it. If you liked the first one, you won't want to miss this part of the series.
