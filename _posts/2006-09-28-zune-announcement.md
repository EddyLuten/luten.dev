Microsoft's answer to Apple's iPod will hit the U.S. market on November 14th as announced on the Microsoft.com website. The player will feature a 30GB hard drive, a full color display but annoyingly pre-loaded content such as music, short films and pictures. The music player will be sold for $249.99 a pop and will be available with many expensive addons and accessories. Below is an image of the music player courtesy of Microsoft's press room.
