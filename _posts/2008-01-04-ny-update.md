First of all, happy new year to you all even though it's a bit late. [Have some cake.](https://web.archive.org/web/20080131050654/http://www.giftmela.com/)

I've been keeping busy with some new "projects" lately, most involve OpenGL and Direct3D but more on this later when I have something to show or share.

Right now I've been disappointed with the stability of the new Visual Studio version, 2008. While there are some great new features for C++ programmers, my debugger seems to crash every now and then when debugging native code. I wonder if any of you out there have had the same problemsâ€¦

Nevertheless, I like the new version and what its capable of concerning native C++.
