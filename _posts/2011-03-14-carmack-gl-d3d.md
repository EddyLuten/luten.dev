John Carmack, of DOOM, Wolfenstein, and Quake fame, has spoken out on the issue of Direct3D vs OpenGL in an interview with the folks at bit-tech. [Check out the article here](https://web.archive.org/web/20150215213647/http://www.bit-tech.net/news/gaming/2011/03/11/carmack-directx-better-opengl/). Note that Carmack is still using OpenGL in his game engines because of cross-platform compatibility reasons, but prefers Direct3D's more modern API.

It's sad to see OpenGL in such a state of disrepair that even a contributor (id Software) to the specification denounces the standard.

P.S. Happy Ï€ day.
