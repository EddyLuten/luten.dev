Wow. I was just outside for lunch and I saw this humongous stormfront coming in. It was sunny on the way to work and literally where my job is located a big shadow struck the floor and pitch-black clouds came rolling in. Kinda reminded me of the scene in the new War of the Worlds movie where the first bolts of lightning strike the planet. I have a picture of it on my phone but I donâ€™t have a USB-cord :\|

The blue dot is me in Boca Raton and the Purple dot is my wife in North Lauderdale. Looks so tiny on the map ;)
