Sandy Bridge is Intel's new microarchitecture, slated for release in January of 2011. Sandy Bridge processors will effectively phase-out the current lineup of processors, based on the LGA 1366 socket, with processors fitting a brand new socket, LGA 2011.

While I understand the need for technology to move forward, and am an avid user of Intel CPUs myself, I can't help but feel underwhelmed by the reviews, especially on the IGP (integrated graphics processor) front, the part that concerns me greatly.

The tech that Intel chose to use on the die is the HD 3000, and it's little brother the HD 2000. Let's hope it's nothing like the GMA (Graphics Media Accelerator) X3000 and family, the scourge of the entire IGP world. Please, Intel, *please*.
