Apparently, the DirectX team has had [a blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20100918132444/http://blogs.msdn.com/DirectX/) since late April of this year it's just not very popular I guess.

They've posted a shipload of information over the last couple of months, so if you're like me and had no idea this existed, you'll have quite some reading to catch up to. It's mostly about Windows 7 and the new graphics APIs (Direct2D, DirectWrite, etc.) but it's interesting nonetheless.
