While listening to the 2nd half of the game on the radio I almost bit my fingers off in excitement. With 2-1 on the scoreboard one single goal by Ivory Coast could ruin my joy. I think the game could have been played better in terms of Goal-Count but we won nonetheless. Now I just wait until next wednesday when the Netherlands play Argentina, a game that I wouldn’t want to miss since my manager is from that country. It’s nice to have an immigrant-competative spirit at work, keeps me from falling asleep ;)
