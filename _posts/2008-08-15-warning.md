I don't like Visual Basic, yet in many Microsoft shops, VB is still being used especially in combination with ASP.NET. The problem with Visual Basic is that it's not very strongly typed. Conventions are often thrown out of the window and Senior VB developers often hold their seniority as experience which, is more fiction than fact.

How many more times do I have to see Functions which don't return anything and should have been declared as Subs.

Or:

    Variable 'XYZ' is used before it has been assigned a value.

Or:

    Variable declaration without an 'As' clause; type of Object assumed.

Ugh. You'd think that people with 15 years of development experience wouldn't dismiss this kind of stuff and just do the right thing.
