Well, that didn't take too long.

If you've been following along, you know that I've been trying to use Linux for my local development purposes on [an Intel NUC](/bye-macbook-hello-intel-nuc) (as well as a Lenovo laptop). I have to say, I still love the NUC and am going to find another use for it somehow, I'm just not sure what yet. However, Linux was somewhat of a disaster for me.

I like to think that I really gave desktop Linux a fighting chance. I've been using it for all my development since [October of 2016](/elementary-os-first-impressions) in one flavor or another. I used elementaryOS until around February when I got fed up with its quirks and switched to Ubuntu. Well, I tried. It was an unending battle with drivers, external displays, wiped USB drives, failing installers, and this:

Thankfully, I have almost all of my code in private GitHub repositories, but I did lose some prototypes. I'm not sure if I shouldn't have relied on Ubuntu's Trash mechanism working correctly or if it should just work out of the box, but I don't really care anymore at this point.

So, even though no major Mac changes were announced at WWDC a few days before, I bit the bullet and pulled the trigger on a new 13" 2017 MacBook, which arrived on my doorstep yesterday.

So far, I don't like its lack of non-USB C ports, the touchbar is a bit awkward to use, and the price is just plain wrong ($2,300 for a 13", 3.3GHz i5, 16GB of RAM). However, I do like its light weight, the retina screen, the huge touchpad, its battery life, and the changes to macOS since El Capitan.

Overall, not too bad.

I may do a long term follow up to see if it will last as long as its 2012 15" predecessor. Until then, I'm just happy that I can move files to the trash and potentially restore them if I really want.
