Over the last week I've been annoyed with the capabilities of the Intel 945GM chipset. While this chipset is not widely supported in graphics development, it's a common chipset that Intel has to offer that comes standard with a bunch of PCs. So I've unhooked my Graphics card and attempted to run some of my code through this GPU.

Direct3D seems to work fine, pretty fast too. Pixel Shader version 2.0 seems to be supported through hardware, and Pixel Shader 3.0 through a software device. Now, you'd expect that the OpenGL implementation would have the same capabilities, or at least Pixel Shader 2.0 through hardware.

Turns out that the OpenGL version on this device is OpenGL 1.4 with to my knowledge no support for fragment shaders (`GL_FRAGMENT_PROGRAM_ARB`). I wonder why this is. The hardware capability is available, why not make use of it?

Valve's hardware survey at the time of this post still reports that 22,183 people out there have the Intel (ialmrnt5.dll) driver. If so many gamers are using Intel's chipsets, you can expect the regular end user base to be much larger. Why not give them some updates? Please? :o)
