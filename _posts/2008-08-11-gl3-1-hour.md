> Once upon a time there was a little old API, struggling for its life amongst the giants of software. Little old OpenGL knew that in order to survive it had to adapt to a strange, bewildering and new environment; it was a strange new world indeed. For two years, rumors of old OpenGL's struggles reached the user-groups and there was much rejoicing indeed. But on one faithful day, August the 11th of 2008, OpenGL perished. Its age and idleness had (as with all things good and bad) caught up with him and slayed little old OpenGL in its path.

After reading [the spec](https://web.archive.org/web/20090206153540/http://opengl.org/registry/doc/glspec30.20080811.pdf) and looking desperately for the promised [object model](https://web.archive.org/web/20090206153540/http://scriptionary.com/blog/2008/05/15/why-opengl-30-is-important/), I felt quite like a *(self-censored)* taking the newsletters seriously and writing about them so explicitly.

For those who haven't read the specification yet, it's OpenGL 2.1 plus and minus some stuff, hardly the fruition of two years labor. The anticipation that followed the initial announcement of OpenGL 3.0's Object Model was tremendous. For the first time in a long time, people started noticing OpenGL again and maybe a place for it in modern multimedia applications such as PC games besides id Software's titles.

Alas, it was not to be. Woe is me for my old API is truly dead. D3D, hello.
