As you might know, NVIDIA has recently purchased Ageia, makers of the PhysX real-time physics SDK. Since then, NVIDIA has taken over the development of the SDK and a new version of the SDK is now available for free in binary form from the NVIDIA website, [click here to go to check it out](https://web.archive.org/web/20090207202531/http://developer.nvidia.com/object/physx.html). A special license for the source code version of the SDK can be acquired for a mere $50K.

In other NVIDIA news: two new free book releases are now available on the NVIDIA website, namely: The [Cg Tutorial](https://web.archive.org/web/20090207202531/http://http.developer.nvidia.com/CgTutorial/cg_tutorial_chapter01.html) and [GPU Gems 2](https://web.archive.org/web/20090207202531/http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems2/gpugems2_part01.html) which are two incredibly useful books. NVIDIA is on a roll, and looking at the manner in which freebies are coming in lately, I’ll be the last one to stop ‘em.
