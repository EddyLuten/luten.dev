A sober conversation about AI and jobs with Google's brand new chat AI, Bard, turns into a bit of a mess at the end. I have some experience using ChatGPT but only got access to Bard today. I thought I'd record this to perhaps compare to interactions in the future.

## The Chat

**Me:** In 50 years, which jobs do you think won't be affected or overtaken by AI?

**Bard:** It is difficult to say for sure which jobs will not be affected or overtaken by AI in 50 years, as technology is constantly evolving. However, some jobs that are likely to be resistant to automation include:

* Jobs that require creativity and problem-solving skills.
* Jobs that involve interpersonal interactions.
* Jobs that require a high level of physical fitness or dexterity.
* Jobs that require specialized knowledge or skills.

It is also important to note that even jobs that are not currently automated may be affected by AI in the future. For example, AI could be used to automate tasks that are currently performed by humans, such as writing reports or making presentations. This could lead to job losses in some sectors, but it could also create new opportunities in others.

Overall, it is difficult to say for sure which jobs will be affected or overtaken by AI in 50 years. However, it is important to be aware of the potential impact of AI on the job market and to develop skills that will be in demand in the future.

**Me:** With the current pace of AI development, do you think it's possible for humans to develop these skills before AI catches up? Is it not possible that any skill learned by a human right now will be made obsolete by the time they finish training?

**Bard:** It is difficult to say for sure whether humans can develop the skills they need to keep up with AI before AI catches up. However, there are a few reasons to be optimistic. First, AI is still in its early stages of development, and there are many challenges that need to be overcome before it can truly replicate human intelligence. Second, humans have a natural advantage in terms of creativity, empathy, and critical thinking. These are skills that are difficult to automate, and they are likely to remain in high demand in the future.

However, it is also important to be aware of the potential risks of AI. AI could be used to automate tasks that are currently performed by humans, which could lead to job losses. AI could also be used to manipulate or control people, which could have a negative impact on society.

Overall, it is important to be aware of the potential risks and benefits of AI. It is also important to be open to new opportunities and to develop skills that will be in demand in the future.

**Me:** Given that the introduction of more capable AI into the every day lives of humans has also introduced a significant amount of risk to the livelihoods of said humans, do you think that it is ethical to continue these pursuits?

**Bard:** It is an ethical dilemma to continue the pursuit of AI, given the potential risks to human livelihoods. On the one hand, AI has the potential to improve the lives of many people by automating tasks, providing new services, and helping us to better understand the world around us. On the other hand, AI could also lead to job losses, inequality, and even harm to humans.

There are many different ethical frameworks that can be used to assess the risks and benefits of AI. Some of these frameworks focus on the consequences of AI, while others focus on the rights of humans. Some frameworks are more concerned with the short-term impacts of AI, while others are more concerned with the long-term impacts.

Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to continue the pursuit of AI is a complex one that should be made on a case-by-case basis. There is no easy answer, and there is always the risk of making the wrong decision. However, it is important to continue to have this discussion and to explore the ethical implications of AI.

---

**Me:** Given that those who develop AI have a vested interest in the advancement of AI capabilities, how would you recommend addressing these ethical dilemmas and ensuring that the case-by-case evaluation that you mentioned is done objectively?

**Bard:** There are a few ways to address the ethical dilemmas posed by AI and ensure that case-by-case evaluations are done objectively.

* One way is to develop ethical guidelines for the development and use of AI. These guidelines could be developed by governments, organizations, or even individuals. They would provide a framework for evaluating the ethical implications of AI and for making decisions about its use.

* Another way to address these dilemmas is to promote transparency and accountability in the development and use of AI. This could be done by requiring companies to disclose information about their AI systems, by establishing independent oversight bodies, or by providing a forum for public discussion of AI issues.

* Finally, it is important to educate people about the ethical implications of AI. This could be done through schools, universities, the media, or even through popular culture. By educating people about the potential risks and benefits of AI, we can help them to make informed decisions about its use.

It is important to note that there is no easy solution to the ethical dilemmas posed by AI. However, by taking steps to address these issues, we can help to ensure that AI is used in a way that benefits all of humanity.

**Me:** How could AI help protect or help those whose jobs will be replaced by AI?

**Bard:** Here are some ways how AI can help protect or help those whose jobs will be replaced by AI:

* Retraining and upskilling. AI can help workers retrain and upskill for new jobs that are not yet automated. For example, AI can be used to provide personalized training programs that are tailored to the specific needs of each worker.

* Creating new jobs. AI can also create new jobs that are not yet automated. For example, AI can be used to create jobs in the development and maintenance of AI systems.

* Providing financial assistance. AI can also provide financial assistance to workers who are displaced by automation. For example, AI can be used to provide unemployment benefits or to help workers find new jobs.

* Creating a universal basic income. AI can also help create a universal basic income, which would provide a basic level of income to all citizens, regardless of whether they are employed or not. This could help to reduce the economic hardship that can be caused by automation.

It is important to note that AI is not a solution to the problem of automation. However, AI can help to mitigate the negative effects of automation by providing retraining, upskilling, financial assistance, and creating new jobs.

**Me:** Please explain to me how a person who's job was replaced by AI, which is likely a more affordable solution than hiring a human, would find a new job.

**Bard:** There are a few ways how a person whose job was replaced by AI can find a new job:

* Retraining and upskilling. The first step is to retrain and upskill for a new job that is not yet automated. This can be done through online courses, workshops, or even by getting a new degree or certification.

* Networking. Networking is another important way to find a new job. Attend industry events, connect with people on LinkedIn, and let your friends and family know that you are looking for a new job.

* Online job boards. There are many online job boards where you can search for new jobs. Some of the most popular job boards include Indeed, Monster, and CareerBuilder.

* Temp agencies. Temp agencies can be a good way to find temporary or contract work. This can be a good way to get your foot in the door at a company and to get some experience in a new field.

* Recruiters. Recruiters can also help you find a new job. Recruiters work with companies to fill open positions, and they can help you find jobs that match your skills and experience.

It is important to remember that finding a new job can be a difficult process. It may take some time and effort to find a new job that is a good fit for you. However, there are many resources available to help you find a new job, and it is important to stay positive and to keep trying.

**Me:** That's not very helpful, these are just regular job seeking tips. I was hoping for an answer which would delve into the process of finding a job in a field overtaken by AI.

**Bard:** In a field overtaken by AI, the job market will be very different. There will be new jobs that are not yet automated, but there will also be a lot of competition for these jobs.

To find a job in a field overtaken by AI, you will need to be able to think creatively and to come up with new ideas. You will also need to be able to learn new skills quickly.

Some of the skills that will be in demand in a field overtaken by AI include:

* Creativity. AI is good at following rules and regulations, but it is not good at coming up with new ideas. Humans will still be needed to come up with new ideas and to solve problems in new ways.

* Critical thinking. AI is good at processing information, but it is not good at evaluating information and making decisions. Humans will still be needed to evaluate information and to make decisions.

* Communication. AI is not good at communicating with humans. Humans will still be needed to communicate with other humans and to work together to solve problems.

If you are interested in finding a job in a field overtaken by AI, you should start by learning about AI and about the skills that will be in demand. You should also start by networking with people who are working in this field.

**Me:** As a rule, do you think it's a good idea for humans to compete with AI in a field overtaken by AI?

**Bard:** As a rule, I don't think it's a good idea for humans to compete with AI in a field overtaken by AI. AI is becoming increasingly capable of performing tasks that were once considered to be the exclusive domain of humans. In many cases, AI systems are able to perform these tasks better than humans can.

This is not to say that humans are no longer needed in the workforce. There are still many tasks that require human intelligence and creativity. However, the number of jobs that are being automated is growing, and it is likely that this trend will continue.

If you are thinking about competing with AI in a field overtaken by AI, I would recommend reconsidering. There are many other fields where your skills and talents are likely to be more appreciated.

**Me:** With AI entering the domain of the arts and generating art that is virtually indistinguishable from art created by human artists, do you think that the skill of creativity will continue to be something that will be beneficial for humans to distinguish themselves from AI in the future? Specifically, in the context of the job market.

**Bard:** Yes, I believe that the skill of creativity will continue to be something that will be beneficial for humans to distinguish themselves from AI in the future.

AI is a tool that can be used to generate creative content, but it is not a replacement for human creativity. Humans are still able to think creatively and to come up with new ideas that AI cannot.

In the future, the job market will likely be divided into two types of jobs: those that are automated and those that require human creativity. The jobs that are automated will be those that can be done by machines, such as data entry and customer service. The jobs that require human creativity will be those that require human intelligence and imagination, such as art, music, and writing.

If you want to be successful in the future job market, it is important to develop your creativity and to learn how to use AI to your advantage. AI can help you to generate new ideas and to automate tasks, but it cannot replace human creativity.

**Bard:** Thank you for your feedback. I will definitely look into improving my ability to generate transcripts of chats. I will also consider adding the option to email the transcript to the user as well.

## Conclusion

Well, Bard is still in a private beta type of environment and used for experimental purposes only. Still, some of the answers it gave me before it fell apart entirely are pretty chilling. In a separate chat, I attempted to play a text adventure with Bard, but while entertaining on a comedic level, this fell apart almost right away. Bard requires the user to drive the conversation, which becomes apparent with anything even a little creative. I'm looking forward -- and am a bit scared of -- future iterations of these technologies.
