Here are some personal projects I have worked on.

* [lowpoly_bot](https://github.com/EddyLuten/lowpoly_bot) &middot; 2017-2019 (MIT Licensed)

    A deactivated Twitter bot that responded to anything posted to the #lowpoly hashtag, retweeting and following anyone that posted to it. Includes support for filtering out spammers, written in Python 3 with a SQLite database backend (included).

* [trace.rs](https://github.com/EddyLuten/trace.rs) &middot; 2019 (MIT Licensed)

    A toy ray tracer written in Rust as a learning exercise.

    A [Google Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sort-hangouts-tab-in-gmai/kidpfddmdpkgilenchiaeehgfilnhapf) to sort the Google Hangouts tab in GMail by status.

* [ahrda](https://github.com/EddyLuten/ahrda)

    A backup of Ahrda.info, which used to host a Wiki detailing the world in which my homebrew D&D game was set. The site no longer exists, but its contents were saved onto GitHub.

* [dotfiles](https://github.com/EddyLuten/dotfiles) &middot; 2018 - present (MIT Licensed)

    I like being able to get up and running quickly after installing my OS, so I keep my dotfiles version controlled.

* [Atom Line-Breaker Package](https://github.com/EddyLuten/line-breaker) &middot; 2015 - 2018 (MIT Licensed)

    I often had the need to break lines by my preferred line boundary settings and had no way of doing so using Atom. So, I wrote a package to do so.

* [Ishin Ruby Gem](https://github.com/EddyLuten/ishin) &middot; 2015 (MIT Licensed)

    Converts Ruby objects to hash representations.
