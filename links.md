Web 1.0 style links to places I like to visit.

- [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) - the library I like to use to create quick game prototypes.
- [MonoGame](https://monogame.net/) - a library much more suited for finished game projects.
- [JFXR](https://jfxr.frozenfractal.com/) - a browser-based SFXR alternative with preset memory.
- [The StoryGraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/) - if you're a reader and don't want to stuff Jeff's pockets, this has everything you need to replace Goodreads.
- [Easing Functions Cheat Sheet](https://easings.net/) - infinitely useful to cheat off.
- [General Protection Fault](https://gpfault.net/) - though abandoned, it is still full of interesting posts.
